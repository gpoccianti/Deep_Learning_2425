## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze the ability of neural networks to approximate **nonlinear operators**, a fundamental problem in scientific machine learning.  
In particular, we focus on **Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets)**, introduced by Lu *et al.* in their work:  

> **Learning nonlinear operators via DeepONet based on the universal approximation theorem**  
> [Lu, Jin, Pang, Zhang, Karniadakis (2019, arXiv:1910.03193)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03193)

The official implementation and related resources can be found on the authorsâ€™ GitHub repository:

## Objectives

- Study the **theoretical framework** of operator learning.  
- Reproduce and extend experiments based on DeepONet architectures.  
- Investigate the impact of architectural choices (branch/trunk networks, activation functions, depth/width).  
- Evaluate generalization capability across different function spaces.
